Конспект
Hello everyone! My name is Enkhe. I'm 27 years old and I'm a junior front-end developer. I live in Ulaanbaatar, country Mongolia. Let me tell you a little bit about myself.
I'm studying Educational Psychology at TRANSBAIKAL State University. I'm pursuing this education more for personal enrichment, to better understand people and have the opportunity to help them.
For the past five years, I have been actively involved in assisting my aunt with the development of her construction and household store. Working in these industries has sparked my keen interest in business models and processes.
My business experience has provided me with valuable practical knowledge and helped me realize that every industry has its own unique characteristics and growth potential. Having interacted extensively with digital technologies from a young age, I found my skills, knowledge, and experience to be instrumental in my work. While working with various websites, applications, and devices in the business, I discovered the rapid growth and endless possibilities of web development.
That's when I came across front-end development. As I delved deeper into front-end development, I was amazed by the personal growth it offers and its potential to benefit people as a whole. That's why I want to apply my skills in development to create innovative and efficient solutions that can enhance business processes and empower individuals in different fields.
Currently, I have a solid grasp of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript Basics, Git, GitHub, Figma Basics, and Markdown. These skills have enabled me to complete several projects, one of which is the "SHELTER" project, an online pet store for dogs. In this project, I extensively used and practiced the three pillars of front-end development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although JavaScript presented its challenges, I found the assignment incredibly rewarding. What I particularly enjoyed about such projects is the constant opportunity for improvement and learning new technologies and techniques.
Another significant advantage of being a front-end developer is proficiency in English. At present, I'm fluent in two languages: Russian and Buryat. I'm currently studying and refreshing my English skills at the A2 level, concurrently revisiting the foundation I acquired during my school years. I think it’s cool. Proficiency in English will open up more opportunities for me, as it does for many developers, because programmers are in demand worldwide, and what unites us all? It's the English language. Most work, documentation, books, forums, and more are written in English.
So, learn English and programming, my dear friend. Discover new possibilities for you. I wish you all love and good health. Hope to see you again. Goodbye.
